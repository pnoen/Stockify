<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Stockify is our customised solution to the problems observed in current stock inventory management systems. We have found a particular use case of it applied in the construction industry, where there is excess stock that is normally not tracked. A business may have a batch order for new steel beams, and the supplier will send them their steel beams. The business will cut the amount needed for their project and then rest be stored without systematic tracking. This gap in inventory management can lead to inefficiencies when assessing whether there's a need for new orders or if the reserve stock suffices. Stockify hopes to help the business in managing their excess of products and streamline the entire stock management process for both supplier and customer through centralising the process on our online platform.
